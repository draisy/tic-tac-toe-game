### Features
I used the minimax algorithm to implement the perfect player, and thus make it unbeatable. The algorithm uses the fact that players are working towards opposite goals to make predictions about which future states the game will reach. The theory behind minimax is that the current opponent will be always be attempting to minimize whatever value the current player (algorithm) is trying to maximize. Ergo, "minimax".
